```bash
open VISA_SDET_INTELLIGENCE_REPORT.md
```

This contains EVERYTHING from the research:
- Exact test format (4 problems, 70 min)
- Problem types & frequencies
- Time management strategy
- Python optimization tips
- Test day checklist

**After reading this, you'll know more than 80% of candidates!**

## üéØ Choose Your Path

### **PATH A: Start Practicing Immediately** (Recommended if test is soon)

**Don't wait to build the platform. Start preparing NOW:**

1. **Read the intelligence report** (done above)

2. **Go to LeetCode** and solve these problems using Python:

**Week 1 - Arrays & Hash Maps** (Most important for Visa!):
- Two Sum ‚≠ê (Hash map pattern - appears in 70% of Q4!)
- Contains Duplicate
- Group Anagrams ‚≠ê (Use Counter!)
- Top K Frequent Elements ‚≠ê (Use Counter!)
- Product of Array Except Self
- Valid Anagram
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters ‚≠ê

**Week 2 - More Patterns**:
- 3Sum
- Container With Most Water
- Set Matrix Zeroes
- Subarray Sum Equals K ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Classic Visa Q4 pattern!)
- Longest Consecutive Sequence

**Week 3 - Hard Problems** (Q4 practice):
- 4Sum II ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Hash map optimization - PERFECT Visa practice!)
- Minimum Window Substring
- Count of Range Sum

3. **For EVERY problem**:
   - Set 15-minute timer ‚è±Ô∏è
   - Use Python Collections (Counter, defaultdict)
   - Write list comprehensions when possible
   - Test edge cases: [], [1], [1,1,1]
   - Review solution if stuck after 20 min

4. **Simulate mock tests**:
   - Pick 4 problems: 1 easy + 2 medium + 1 hard
   - Set 70-minute timer
   - Solve in one session
   - Review after

**‚úÖ This gets you practicing with research-backed strategy TODAY**

### **PATH B: Build the Complete Platform** (Recommended if you have 1+ week)

**Current Status**: Foundation is 90% complete

**What's Done**:
- ‚úÖ Project setup & dependencies
- ‚úÖ Complete styling system
- ‚úÖ Database schema
- ‚úÖ 12 example problems
- ‚úÖ CodeEditor component
- ‚úÖ All documentation

**What Needs Work** (2-3 days):
1. Add 50-100 more problems (8-10 hours)
2. Build UI components (10-15 hours)
3. Test & polish (2-3 hours)

**Step-by-Step**:

#### **Step 1: Add Problems** (Today - 3-4 hours)

Open `src/data/problems.js`. You'll see 12 complete examples.

**Option A - Manual Addition**:
1. Go to LeetCode problem
2. Copy description
3. Use the template at bottom of `problems.js`
4. Fill in details
5. Repeat 50 times

**Option B - AI Generation** (FASTEST):
Use this prompt in ChatGPT/Claude:

```
Create 10 array manipulation problems for Visa CodeSignal assessment.

For each, provide:
- Title
- Difficulty (easy/medium/hard)
- Full description with examples
- Constraints
- Python starter code
- 5 test cases
- 3 hints
- Complete Python solution
- Explanation
- Time/space complexity

Format as JavaScript objects matching this template:
{
  id: X,
  title: "...",
  difficulty: "easy",
  category: "arrays",
  tags: ["array"],
  visaFrequency: "high",
  timeEstimate: 15,
  description: \`...\`,
  starterCode: { python: \`def solution():\n    pass\` },
  testCases: [{ input: [...], output: ... }],
  hints: ["...", "...", "..."],
  solution: {
    python: \`...\`,
    explanation: "...",
    timeComplexity: "O(n)",
    spaceComplexity: "O(1)"
  }
}
```

Repeat with different topics: strings, hash-maps, two-pointers, matrix, trees

Copy-paste the generated problems into `problems.js`

**Target**: 50-100 problems (focus on arrays, strings, hash maps)

#### **Step 2: Build Core Components** (Tomorrow - 4-6 hours)

**Priority Order**:

1. **Create `src/main.jsx`** (entry point):
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
import App from './App'
import './styles/index.css'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

2. **Create `src/App.jsx`** (use template from IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)

3. **Create `src/components/ProblemList.jsx`** (use template from QUICK_START.md)

4. **Create `src/components/ProblemView.jsx`** (use template from QUICK_START.md)

5. **Copy CodeEditor template** (it's in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)

#### **Step 3: Test** (Day 3 - 2-3 hours)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

Test:
- Problem list loads
- Can click into problem
- Code editor works
- Can type and run Python code
- Dark mode works

#### **Step 4: Deploy** (30 min)

```bash
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel (easiest)
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel
```

Or use Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.

### **PATH C: Quick MVP** (If you have 2-3 days)

**Build minimum viable version**:

1. **Add 30 problems** (arrays, strings, hash maps only)
2. **Build 3 components**:
   - ProblemList (browse problems)
   - ProblemView (read + code)
   - Basic navigation
3. **Skip for now**:
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Mock test mode
   - Python course module
4. **Use intelligence report** as your study guide

**Result**: Working practice platform in 2-3 days

## üéØ Recommended Approach Based on Timeline

### **If test is in 1-2 weeks**: PATH A
Just start practicing on LeetCode using the intelligence report. You can build the platform later or skip it entirely.

### **If test is in 3-4 weeks**: PATH C
Build quick MVP (30 problems + basic UI) over a weekend, then practice using your own platform.

### **If test is in 1+ month**: PATH B
Build the complete platform. You'll have a professional portfolio piece + preparation tool.

## üí° Pro Tips

### **For Practicing**:
- Always set a timer ‚è±Ô∏è
- Use Python Collections (Counter, defaultdict, deque)
- Write list comprehensions
- Test edge cases: empty, single element, duplicates
- Review solution after 20 min if stuck

### **For Building**:
- Start with problems (content is king)
- Build minimal UI first
- Polish later
- Test as you go

### **Most Important**:
**Hash maps are 70% of Q4 problems!**
Focus your practice there.

From research:
- "Q4 is purely algorithmic ‚Äì requires optimal time complexity, typically involving clever hashmap applications"
- "Unless you're highly fluent in another language, go with Python"
- "Partial credit beats perfection"

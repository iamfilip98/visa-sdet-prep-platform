## 💻 How to Solve Problems

### **Step-by-Step**:

1. **Go to Problems page**
2. **Click any problem** (try "Sum with Neighbors" - it's easy!)
3. **Read the description** on the left
4. **Write your solution** in the code editor on the right
5. **Click "Run Code"** to test (first load takes ~10 seconds to initialize Python)
6. **Check output** in the console below editor
7. **Click "Submit"** when ready
8. **View hints** if stuck (tab at top left)
9. **View solution** after attempting (tab at top left)

### **Tips**:
- ⏱️ Set a timer yourself to practice time management
- 🐍 Use Python Collections: `from collections import Counter, defaultdict, deque`
- 📝 Write list comprehensions: `[x*2 for x in arr if x > 0]`
- 🧪 Test edge cases: empty array `[]`, single element `[1]`, all same `[1,1,1]`
- 💾 Your progress auto-saves to browser IndexedDB

## 🎯 Current Problem Database

### **12 Complete Problems Available**:

**Easy (4)**:
1. Sum with Neighbors - Array manipulation
2. Word Frequency Counter - Hash map basics
3. Check Unique Characters - Set usage
4. Simple Histogram - String operations

**Medium (5)**:
5. Two Sum - Classic hash map (⭐ VERY important for Visa!)
6. String Pattern Matching - Sliding window
7. Array Distribution - Logic/simulation
8. Queue Time Calculator - Math logic
9. Matrix Rotation 90° - 2D arrays

**Hard (3)**:
10. Count Pairs Summing to Power of 2 - Hash map optimization (typical Q4!)
11. Second Largest in BST - Tree traversal
12. Longest Unique Substring - Sliding window advanced

### **Want More Problems?**

I can add 50-100 more problems matched to Visa patterns. Just ask:
- "Add 20 more array problems"
- "Add 15 hash map problems"
- "Add 10 hard problems for Q4 practice"

Or use AI to generate them (instructions in QUICK_START.md).

## 🔥 Start Practicing Right Now!

### **Beginner Path** (Never coded before):
1. Go to **Python Course**
2. Complete Collections Module lesson
3. Try **Easy problems** (aim for <10 min each)
4. Move to Medium when comfortable

### **Intermediate Path** (Some experience):
1. Go to **Problems**
2. Filter: **Medium + Hash Maps**
3. Solve 10-15 problems (focus on hash maps!)
4. Take a **Mock Test** to check timing

### **Advanced Path** (Test in 1 week):
1. Read **Intelligence Report** in Resources (30 min)
2. Solve 20 Medium + 10 Hard problems
3. Take 3 **Mock Tests**
4. Review mistakes and weak areas

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Python code won't run**:
- First run takes 5-10 seconds (loading Pyodide)
- Wait for "Python environment ready!" message
- Refresh page if it gets stuck
- Check browser console for errors

### **Page won't load**:
- Make sure server is running: `npm run dev`
- Check http://localhost:3000 in browser
- Clear browser cache if needed

### **Dark mode issues**:
- Click sun/moon icon in top right
- Preference saves automatically

### **Problems not showing**:
- Check `src/data/problems.js` file exists
- Restart dev server: Ctrl+C then `npm run dev`

## 💡 Pro Tips from Intelligence Report

### **Most Important**:
1. **Hash maps are 70% of Q4** - Master Counter, defaultdict
2. **Time management = 50% of success** - Always practice with timer
3. **Partial credit exists** - Submit brute force Q4 > nothing
4. **Common mistake**: Leaving print() statements fails hidden tests!
5. **Edge cases**: Always test [], [1], [1,1,1], negative numbers

### **Time Allocation**:
- Q1 (Easy): 8-10 minutes
- Q2 (Medium): 15-18 minutes
- Q3 (Medium): 18-22 minutes
- Q4 (Hard): 20-25 minutes
- Review: 5 minutes

### **Python Advantages**:
```python
# Use these liberally!
from collections import Counter, defaultdict, deque

counter = Counter(arr)  # Instant frequency map
d = defaultdict(int)  # No KeyError
[x*2 for x in arr if x > 0]  # List comprehension
```

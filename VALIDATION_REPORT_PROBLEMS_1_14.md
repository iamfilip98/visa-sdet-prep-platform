## Detailed Results by Problem

### ✅ PASSING - Problems 1-5

| Problem | Title | Tests | Status |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Sum with Neighbors | 5/5 | ✓ ALL PASS |
| 2 | Word Frequency Counter | 4/4 | ✓ ALL PASS |
| 3 | Check Unique Characters | 5/5 | ✓ ALL PASS |
| 4 | Simple Histogram | 4/4 | ✓ ALL PASS |
| 5 | Two Sum | 4/4 | ✓ ALL PASS |

**Analysis:** All basic problems pass completely. Solutions are correct and test cases are valid.

---

### ⚠️ PROBLEM 6: String Pattern Matching - TEST CASE ERROR

**Status:** 4/5 tests pass
**Issue:** Test case #5 has incorrect expected output

#### Failing Test Case (Line 351 in problems.js):
```javascript
{ input: ["test", "##"], output: 2 }  // ❌ INCORRECT
```

#### Detailed Analysis:
```
String: "test"
Pattern: "##" (consonant + consonant)
Vowels: a, e, i, o, u, y

Sliding window analysis:
- Position 0-1: "te" → t(consonant) + e(vowel) → NO MATCH
- Position 1-2: "es" → e(vowel) + s(consonant) → NO MATCH
- Position 2-3: "st" → s(consonant) + t(consonant) → ✓ MATCH

Actual matches: 1
Expected in test: 2
```

#### Recommendation:
```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect):
{ input: ["test", "##"], output: 2 }

// AFTER (correct):
{ input: ["test", "##"], output: 1 }
```

**OR** if you want 2 matches, use a different test string:
```javascript
{ input: ["tests", "##"], output: 2 }  // "st" and "ts" both match
```

### ✅ PASSING - Problems 7-9

| Problem | Title | Tests | Status |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 7 | Array Distribution | 4/4 | ✓ ALL PASS |
| 8 | Queue Entry Time Calculator | 5/5 | ✓ ALL PASS |
| 9 | Matrix Rotation 90 Degrees | 3/3 | ✓ ALL PASS |

**Analysis:** Medium difficulty problems all pass. Solutions handle edge cases correctly.

### ⚠️ PROBLEM 10: Count Pairs Summing to Power of 2 - TEST CASE ERROR

**Status:** 3/4 tests pass
**Issue:** Test case #4 has incorrect expected output

#### Failing Test Case (Line 626 in problems.js):
```javascript
{ input: [[1, 2, 4, 8]], output: 3 }  // ❌ INCORRECT
```

#### Detailed Analysis:
```
Array: [1, 2, 4, 8]
Powers of 2: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256...

All pairs (i < j) and their sums:
- (0,1): 1 + 2 = 3  → NOT a power of 2 ❌
- (0,2): 1 + 4 = 5  → NOT a power of 2 ❌
- (0,3): 1 + 8 = 9  → NOT a power of 2 ❌
- (1,2): 2 + 4 = 6  → NOT a power of 2 ❌
- (1,3): 2 + 8 = 10 → NOT a power of 2 ❌
- (2,3): 4 + 8 = 12 → NOT a power of 2 ❌

Actual matches: 0
Expected in test: 3
```

#### Recommendation:
```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect):
{ input: [[1, 2, 4, 8]], output: 3 }

// AFTER (correct):
{ input: [[1, 2, 4, 8]], output: 0 }
```

**OR** use a test case that actually has 3 pairs:
```javascript
// Option 1: Use the existing test case from line 623 (already works)
{ input: [[1, 3, 5, 7]], output: 3 }
// Pairs: (1,3)=4, (1,7)=8, (3,5)=8 ✓

// Option 2: Create new test with 3 matches
{ input: [[1, 1, 1, 7]], output: 3 }
// Pairs: (0,1)=2, (0,3)=8, (1,3)=8 ✓
```

### ✅ PASSING - Problems 11-14

| Problem | Title | Tests | Status |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 11 | Second Largest in BST | 1/1 | ✓ ALL PASS |
| 12 | Maximum Subarray Sum | 5/5 | ✓ ALL PASS |
| 13 | Product of Array Except Self | 2/2 | ✓ ALL PASS |
| 14 | Find Peak Element | 2/2 | ✓ ALL PASS |

**Analysis:** Hard problems all pass. Solutions demonstrate correct algorithm implementations.

## Summary of Issues

### Issues Found

1. **Problem 6 (String Pattern Matching):** Test case expects 2 matches but correct answer is 1
   - Location: `src/data/problems.js` line 351
   - Impact: Low (solution is correct, only test case needs update)

2. **Problem 10 (Count Pairs Summing to Power of 2):** Test case expects 3 matches but correct answer is 0
   - Location: `src/data/problems.js` line 626
   - Impact: Low (solution is correct, only test case needs update)

### Root Cause Analysis

Both errors appear to be manual mistakes when creating test cases:
- **Problem 6:** Likely miscounted substring matches
- **Problem 10:** May have confused the problem requirement (sum of pairs vs. individual elements being powers of 2)

### No Issues Found In

- ✅ All solution implementations (all are correct)
- ✅ Solution algorithms and logic
- ✅ Edge case handling
- ✅ Time/space complexity implementations

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Problem 6 test case:**
   ```javascript
   // File: src/data/problems.js, line 351
   // Change from:
   { input: ["test", "##"], output: 2 }
   // To:
   { input: ["test", "##"], output: 1 }
   ```

2. **Fix Problem 10 test case:**
   ```javascript
   // File: src/data/problems.js, line 626
   // Change from:
   { input: [[1, 2, 4, 8]], output: 3 }
   // To:
   { input: [[1, 2, 4, 8]], output: 0 }
   ```

### Quality Assurance

1. ✅ **Run comprehensive test suite** after fixes
2. ✅ **Validate all 14 problems** pass 100% of tests
3. ✅ **Consider adding more edge cases** for problems 11, 13, 14 (currently have few tests)

### Additional Testing

Consider adding these test cases for better coverage:

**Problem 11 (BST):**
- Test with larger trees
- Test with skewed trees (all left or all right)
- Test with minimum 2-node tree

**Problem 13 (Product Except Self):**
- More tests with zeros
- Tests with negative numbers
- Tests with larger arrays

**Problem 14 (Peak Element):**
- Tests with multiple peaks
- Tests with descending/ascending arrays
- Tests with all equal elements

2. **VALIDATION_REPORT_PROBLEMS_1_14.md** - This detailed report

## Conclusion

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT (96.2% pass rate)**

- 12/14 problems (85.7%) have perfect implementations with valid test cases
- 2/14 problems (14.3%) have correct implementations but invalid test cases
- **0 problems have implementation errors**

All solutions are correctly implemented. The two failures are due to test case data errors, not code bugs. After fixing the two test cases in `problems.js`, all problems will achieve 100% pass rate.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Fix the 2 test cases identified above
2. Re-run test suite to verify 100% pass rate
3. Consider expanding test coverage for problems with fewer test cases
4. Validate problems 15-29 (as mentioned, already validated separately)
